## What do we want to be able to do?

- Communicate findings effectively 

- Encompass and document entire data analysis process

- Document findings 

- Make process reproducible  

- Share process



## Where do we start?  

- Review of Key Concepts  

- R Markdown Basics  
    + Code Chunks
    + Images/Equations/Misc.

- R Markdown Options
    + Documents: PDF, HTML 
    + Presentations: Slides
    + Interactive Components

- R Shiny Applications/Presentations


## Review of Concepts
**R Studio**

- Great integrated development environment (IDE)  

- Four main 'areas' we'll use  
    + Scripting and Viewing Area  
    + Workspace/History  
    + Files/Plots/Help  
    + Console
    

## Review of Concepts
**R Studio** - Can rearrange panes

```{r panes.png, out.width = "800px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/panes.png")
```

- Global options --> Appearance allows font/background changes


## Review of Concepts
**R Studio** - Project

> - Often have many files associated with each analysis  

> - Keeping different undertakings separate can be difficult!

> - Can use "Project" feature in R Studio  

> - Provides straightforward way to divide your work into multiple contexts.  Each with their own:    
    <ul>  
      <li> Working directory</li>
      <li> Workspace</li>  
      <li> History</li>  
      <li> Source documents</li>  
    </ul>


## Review of Concepts
**R Studio** - Project

- Easy to create!  

```{r project.png, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project.png")
```

- Can save workspace, etc. and pick up right where you left off!  
- Work on multiple projects at once  


## Review of Concepts  
**Data Frames**

- Best R object for data sets
- Collection (list) of vectors of the same **length**

```{r iris-tibble}
iris<-tbl_df(iris); iris
```

## Review of Concepts
**Data Frames**  

- Accessing elements: multiple ways

```{r index-df1}
iris[1:4, 2:4]
```


## Review of Concepts
**Data Frames**  

- Accessing elements: multiple ways

```{r index-df2}
iris[1, ]
```


## Review of Concepts
**Data Frames**  

- Accessing elements: multiple ways

```{r index-df3}
iris[ , c("Sepal.Length", "Species")]
```


## Review of Concepts
**Data Frames**  

- Accessing elements: multiple ways

```{r index-df4}
iris$Sepal.Length
```

## Review of Concepts  
**Packages**
- Many ways to accomplish the same thing in R

> - How to choose?  
     <ul>
       <li>Want 'fast' code</li>
       <li>Want 'easy' syntax</li>  
       <li>Good default settings on functions</li>  
     </ul>
     
> - Base R has reasonable defaults and syntax but functions are slow  

> - "[TidyVerse](http://tidyverse.org/)" - collection of R packages that share common philosophies and are designed to work together!  
    <ul>
      <li>Very efficient code</li>
      <li>Common syntax</li>  
    </ul>


## Review of Concepts  

- If not installed (downloaded) on computer

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


## Review of Concepts  

- Once installed, `library()` or `require()` to load
```{r tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```    


## Tidyverse Syntax

 - All packages have similar syntax!  All work on `tibbles` (epecial data frames)  

> - Convert any data frame (or matrix) to a tibble using `tbl_df()`

> - Nice printing properties (can sometimes cause issues though)

> - Most packages have syntax: `function(data.frame, options)`



## Tidyverse Syntax

 - All packages have similar syntax!  All work on `tibbles` (epecial data frames)  

 - Convert any data frame (or matrix) to a tibble using `tbl_df()`

 - Nice printing properties (can sometimes cause issues though)

 - Syntax: `function(data.frame, options)`

- Examples:
```{r ggplot,eval=FALSE}
select(iris, Sepal.Width)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_point()
```


## Review of Concepts

- Read in most any type of data with 
    + readr (.csv, delimited data)  
    + readxl (.xls, .xlsx)  
    + haven (.sav, .dta, .sas7bdat)  
    
```{r votingDataP,eval=FALSE}
#read in data (readr, readxl, haven packages)
votingData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
                       jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/datasets/counties.csv")
```

## Review of Concepts  

```{r votingDataE,eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#read in data (readr, readxl, haven packages)
votingData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/datasets/counties.csv")
```
```{r}
votingData
```


## Review of Concepts  
**Piping or Chaining**

- Applying multiple functions: nesting hard to parse!
- Piping or Chaining with %>% operator helps



## Review of Concepts  
**Piping or Chaining**

- Applying multiple functions: nesting hard to parse!
- Piping or Chaining with %>% operator helps
- If `dplyr` or `magrittr` package loaded, can use anywhere
```{r pipingP,eval=FALSE}
#Consider
votingData %>% 
  filter((state == "NC") & (college > 20)) %>% 
  select(county, msa, pop.density:turnout) %>% 
  arrange(college, desc(turnout))
#vs
arrange(select(filter(votingData, ((state == "NC") & (college > 20))), 
               county, msa, pop.density:turnout), college, desc(turnout))
```

## Review of Concepts  
**Piping or Chaining**

```{r pipingE}
votingData %>% 
  filter((state == "NC") & (college > 20)) %>% 
  select(county, msa, pop.density:turnout) %>% 
  arrange(college, desc(turnout))
```

## Review of Concepts  
**Plotting**  

- R great for plotting  

> - We'll use `ggplot2` in `tidyverse`! [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf)  

> - Needs:  Data Frame
> - Aesthetic (aes) - maps variables to properties of geom
      <ul>
         <li> Ex: size, color, and x, y location(s) </li>
        </ul>
> - Geom layer(s) (visualizaton type(s))  
> - Coordinate system (mostly use Cartesian plane)  
> - Optional: Stat layer, titles, etc.


## Review of Concepts  
`ggplot2` needs and syntax

Needs:

- Data Frame  
- Aesthetic (aes) - maps variables to properties of geom  
- Geom layer(s) (visualizaton type(s))    
- Optional: Stat layer, titles, etc.  
 
- Syntax:

```{r ggplot-syntax,eval=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(dataframe,aes(x = , y = , ...))
g + geom_type(...) +
  stat_type(...) + 
  labs(...)
```

## Review of Concepts

- Settings that depend on a variable go in `aes`  

```{r ggplot-facet-exP,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(votingData, aes(x = income, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, aes(color = college)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_rug() +
  facet_grid(region ~ .)
g
```

## Review of Concepts

```{r ggplot-face-exE,eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(votingData, aes(x = income, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, aes(color = college)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_rug() +
  facet_grid(region ~ .)
g
```

```{r process.png, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/process.png")
```  

(From R for Data Science)  


## R Markdown Basics 

- Can read data into R 

- Know how to manipulate it  

- Likely know best ways to model and visualize it

> - Doesn’t matter how great your analysis is unless you can explain it to others :)

> - Need to communicate results effectively


## R Markdown Basics  
**What is Markdown?**  

- Formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, slide shows, books, and more.  

> - Digitial "Notebook":  Program that weaves word processing and code.  [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/IntermediateRI.Rmd)  

> - Can do interactive documents! 


## R Markdown Basics  
**How to use Markdown?**  

Designed to be used in three ways (R for Data Science)  

> + Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code)

> + Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!)

> + As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking)

[Examples](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) of markdown documents


## R Markdown Basics
**Verbage**

- Most have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
    
## R Markdown Basics
**Verbage**

- Most have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
- Markdown is a specific markup language  
    + Easier syntax  
    + Not as powerful  
    
- Any plain text file with .Rmd extension can be used  


## R Markdown Basics
**R Markdown Basics**

R Markdown file contains three important types of content:

> 1. (Optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s  

> 2. Chunks of R code surrounded by ```  

> 3. Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_  


## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- R Studio makes it easy!  

```{r startMD.png, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMD.png")
```


## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Commonly used document types can be created 

<div style="float: center;">
```{r startMDDoc.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDDoc.png")
```
</div>



## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Slide presentations 

```{r startMDPres.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDPres.png")
```



## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Truly Interactive Documents/Pages (requires R backend)

```{r startMDShiny.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDShiny.png")
```

## R Markdown Basics

- Create an HTML Markdown document!
```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Justin Post"
date: "August 10, 2017"
output: html_document
---
```  

 - Top section:  YAML header     
 
> - Define settings for document  

> - Author, Title, etc.  

> - Output type/Options  


     
## R Markdown Basics
     
 - Below YAML header: 'r chunk'  

```{r chunk_png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunk.png")
```  

> - Start code chunk by typing it out or with CTRL/CMD + Alt + I

> - Code will be executed when document is created    

> - Specify options about individual chunk here  


## R Markdown Basics
     
- Below code chunk is plain text with markdown sytnax  

```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. 
```

- When file created, "##" becomes a header, "<...>" a link, and "**...**" bold font

## Where do we go from here?  

- Figure out markdown syntax  

> - Look at "Notebook" feature  

> - Check options for code chunks  

> - Automate some things  

> - Change type of output  

> - Work with interactivity (shiny)  


## R Markdown Syntax  

You can include:  

> - Plain text  
> - End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph  
  <ul>  
      <li> Line breaks are not always added when you return!</li>
      <li> Two spaces and a return drop marked up text down.</li>
      <li> Can specify ```<br>```  as a line break</li>
  </ul>  
  
> - ```*italics*``` *and* ```_italics_```  

> - ```**bold**``` **and** ```__bold__```

> - ```superscript^2^``` becomes superscript^2^  

> - ```~~strikethrough~~```  becomes ~~strikethrough~~


## R Markdown Syntax  

- ```[link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)``` becomes [link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)  

> - ```# Header 1``` becomes a large font header  

> - ```## Header 2``` becomes a slightly smaller font header  

> - Goes to 6 headers  

> - Use of headers can automatically create a Table of Contents!

> - Include an image: ```![](path/to/file.png)```  


## R Markdown Syntax

- Can do lists: be sure to end each line with two spaces!  
  + Indent sub lists two spaces (I often do four for both) 

<div style = "float: left; width: 50%">
```
* unordered list  
* item 2  
  + sub-item 1  
  + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  
  + sub-item 1  
  + sub-item 2  
```  
</div>
<div style = "float: right; width: 50%">
* unordered list  
* item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  
</div>


## R Markdown Syntax  

- Can include nice tables  

```
Table Header  | Second Header | Col 3
------------- | ------------- | -----------
Table Cell    | Cell (1, 2)   | Cell (1, 3)
Cell (2, 1)   | Cell (2, 2)   | Cell (2, 3) 
```
Table Header  | Second Header | Col 3
------------- | ------------- | -----------
Table Cell    | Cell (1, 2)   | Cell (1, 3)
Cell (2, 1)   | Cell (2, 2)   | Cell (2, 3)

## Where are we at?  

- Review of Key Concepts  

- R Markdown Basics  
    + **Code Chunks**  
    + **Images/Equations/Misc.**

- R Markdown Options
    + Documents: PDF, HTML 
    + Presentations: Slides
    + Interactive Components
    
- R Shiny Applications/Presentations


## Code Chunks  

We've already seen how to include an R code chunk:
```{r chunk.png, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunk.png")
```   

- Add chunk via typing it out or `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`  

- Any R code can go into the chunk  


## Notebook Functionality  

Data science notebook - virtual notebook environment used for literate programming  

> - Pairs the functionality of word processing software with a programming language


> - Rendered markdown document captures R code and process  

> - R Markdown brings together the console and the script editor too!  

> - Blurs line between interactive exploration and long-term code capture. 


## Notebook Functionality  

Within a chunk:  

 - Execute code with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter` or with "Run"  

```{r chunkRun.png, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunkRun.png")
```
> - Results show up in editor!  


## Notebook Functionality  

 - Allows for quick iteration within a chunk: editing and re-executing - when you’re happy, you move on and start a new chunk.

> - Go back to markdown template document, execute code chunk in-line  

> - Can run all code chunks with `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + R`  

> - Can develop code and record your thoughts - similar to classic lab notebook in the physical sciences


## Back to Code Chunks  

- Many options depending on chunk purpose!    

> - Can hide/show code with `echo = FALSE/TRUE'

> - Can choose if code is evaluated with `eval = TRUE/FALSE'   

> - `Include = FALSE` is equivalent to `echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE`    

> - Useful for set-up code (usually first chunk after YAML header) 


## Code Chunks  

- `message = TRUE/FALSE` and `warning = TRUE/FALSE` can turn on/off displaying messages/warnings   

> - `error = TRUE` allows file to be created with code that has an error

> - Code can be added in line:  Ex: Iris has `r length(iris$Sepal.Length)` observations  

> - Added by beginning with back-tick `r` and ending with a back-tick


## Code Chunks  

Meantioned using `Include = FALSE` for 'set-up code' (usually first chunk after YAML header)  

> - Can set global options for chunks  

> - Allows for easy change of audience!  

```
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

## Code Chunks  

Can name code chunks to help organization!  

> - When calling a chunk, add name after `r`  ({r name-of-chunk, options...})  

> - TOC type menu in bottom left of notebook editor!  

```{r TOC.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/TOC.png")
```

## Code Chunks

In a large analysis it may take a long time to run code chunks/knit your document  

> - Can "Cache" results!  Code will only rerun if it has changed.  

> - Option to set up code dependencies using chunk names

> - Use `cache = TRUE` in code chunk definition

> - Can do global option for caching!

> - Delete folders created to rerun everything


## Images/Equations and Misc.

Adding images in markdown: `![](path/to/file)`  

> - Not ideal... difficult to control size/scale  

> - Better way to add images use R code!  

> - `knitr` package has `include_graphics` function  

> - Use knitr or code chunk options to control size/scale!

> - Ex:  {r graphics, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path/to/file)



## Images/Equations and Misc.

Adding Equations  

> - Inline equation: ```$A = \pi*r^{2}$``` becomes $A = \pi*r^{2}$  

> - Block equation ```$$A = \pi*r^{2}$$``` becomes $$A = \pi*r^{2}$$  

> - Outputting equations for HTML is done through MathJax (javascript)  

> - For PDFs it is done through LaTeX (may need to install)  


## Images/Equations and Misc.

Outputting data tables better with `kable` from `knitr` package

<div style = "float: left; width = 40%;">
```{r kable, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
</div>
<div style = "float: right; width = 55%;">
```{r kable2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
kable(summary(cars))
```
</div>

For html_documents another option is to make the code chunks hidden by default, but visible with a click:

```
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
```

## Common Outputs  

Presentations/Slides  

- `output: ioslides_presentation` - HTML presentation

- `slidy_presentation` - HTML presentation

- `beamer_presentation` - PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer

- Shiny (covered later) slides   

```
output: html_document
runtime: shinyShiny Slides
```

## Common Outputs  

Can create more than one document at a time!  

- Just add another output statement in the YAML header  

```
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
  word_document: default 

```
Then use code:  

`rmarkdown::render("file.Rmd", output_format = "all")`


## Parameters  

Parameters can be added to the YAML header  

 - Can help to automate reports!

```
title: "NFL Reports"
author: "Justin Post"
date: "August 10-11, 2017"
output: html_document  
params: 
      team: "Pittsburgh Steelers"
```

> - Access via params$team  

> - Can 'Knit with parameters'  

> - Example: Let's open up the [NFL.Rmd document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/NFL.Rmd)


## Automation of Documents  

- Create data frame for each class (here team)  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
scoreData <- read_csv("https://github.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/blob/master/datasets/scoresFull.csv?raw=true")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
scoreData <- read_csv("https://github.com/jbpost2/
											IntermediateR/blob/master/datasets/scoresFull.csv?raw=true")
```
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
reports <- tibble(
  teamIDs = unique(scoreData$awayTeam),
  filename = stringr::str_c("TeamID-", teamIDs, ".html"),
  params = purrr::map(teamIDs, ~ list(team = .))
)
```

## Automation of Documents  

```{r}
reports
```

## Automation of Documents  

Now knit via the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reports %>% 
  select(output_file = filename, params) %>% 
  purrr::pwalk(rmarkdown::render, input = "NFL.Rmd")
```

## Interactivity  

HTML documents inherently interactive  

- Widgets can be included  

```{r leafletP, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  setView(174.764, -36.877, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(174.764, -36.877, popup = "Maungawhau") 
```

## Interactivity    

```{r leafletE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  setView(174.764, -36.877, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(174.764, -36.877, popup = "Maungawhau") 
```

## Interactivity   

Interactive tables with `DT` library

```{r DTP, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```

## Interactivity   

```{r DTE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```


## Interactivity 

- 3d scatterplots with `rthreejs` package  
```{r scatter3dP, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bwlewis/rthreejs")

library(threejs)

scatterplot3js(x = iris$Sepal.Width, y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
							 z = iris$Petal.Width, color = 
							 	c(rep("blue", 50), rep("red", 50), 
							 		rep("green", 50)), 
							 size = 0.5)
```

## Interactivity 
```{r scatter3dE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(threejs)

scatterplot3js(x = iris$Sepal.Width, y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
							 z = iris$Petal.Width, color = 
							 	c(rep("blue", 50), rep("red", 50), 
							 		rep("green", 50)), 
							 size = 0.5)
```


## Interactivity  

Previous interactivity happened in the browser  

> - Great because anyone can access with a browser  

> - Bad because you can't have as much functionality as you want...

> - Shiny allows for interactivity with R!  

> - Only con: Requires R running somewhere

> - Examples: [Shiny Showcase](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-user-showcase/), [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

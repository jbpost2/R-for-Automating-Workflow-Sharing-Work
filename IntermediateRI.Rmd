## What do we want to be able to do?

- Communicate findings effectively 

- Document findings 

- Make process reproducible  

- Share process



## Where do we start?  

- R Markdown Basics  
    + Code Chunks
    + Images/Equations/Misc.

- R Markdown Options
    + Documents: PDF, HTML 
    + Presentations: Slides
    + Interactive Components

- R Shiny Applications/Presentations


## RStudio

Nice functionality for  

- Markdown  

- Shiny  

- Databases  

- Git/Github  


## RStudio - Project

- Often have many files associated with each analysis  

 - Keeping different undertakings separate can be difficult!

> - Can use "Project" feature in R Studio  

> - Provides straightforward way to divide your work into multiple contexts.  Each with their own:    
    <ul>  
      <li> Working directory</li>
      <li> Workspace</li>  
      <li> History</li>  
      <li> Source documents</li>  
    </ul>


## R Studio - Project

- Easy to create!  

```{r project.png, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project.png")
```

- Can save workspace, etc. and pick up right where you left off!  

- Let's create one for today!  

- Place the [TextActivityPlainText.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/files/TextActivityPlainText.Rmd) file in the project folder  


## R Markdown Basics  

```{r process.png, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/process.png")
```  

(From R for Data Science)  


## R Markdown Basics 

- Can read data into R 

- Ability to manipulate it   

- Likely know best ways to model and visualize it

> - Doesn’t matter how great your analysis is unless you can explain it to others :)

> - Need to communicate results effectively



## (Traditional) Basic Use of R  

- Usually want to keep code for later use  

 - Write code in a 'script'  

 - Save code script  

 - Send lines of code to console via: 
    <ul>
      <li> "Run" button (runs current line)  </li>
      <li> CTRL+Enter (PC) or Command+Enter (MAC)  </li>
      <li> Highlight section and do above</li>
    </ul>


## Using a Notebook Instead  

- Communication and reproducibility vital!  

> - May have heard of [JUPYTER](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks  

> - R Markdown - built in notebook for R studio

> - [Intro video](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/IntermediateR/video/Markdown.mp4)


## R Markdown Basics  
**What is Markdown?**  

- Formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, slide shows, books, and more.  

 - Digital "Notebook":  Program that weaves word processing and code.  [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/IntermediateRI.Rmd)  

Designed to be used in three ways (R for Data Science)  

> + Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code)

> + Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!)  

> + As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking)

> + [Examples](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) of markdown documents



## R Markdown Basics
**Verbage**

- Most have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
    
## R Markdown Basics
**Verbage**

- Most have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
- Markdown is a specific markup language  
    + Easier syntax  
    + Not as powerful  
    
- Any plain text file with .Rmd extension can be used  


## R Markdown Basics
**R Markdown Basics**

R Markdown file contains three important types of content:

> 1. (Optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s  
> 2. Chunks of R code surrounded by ```  
> 3. Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_  


## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- R Studio makes it easy!  

```{r startMD.png, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMD.png")
```


## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Commonly used document types can be created 

<div style="float: center;">
```{r startMDDoc.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDDoc.png")
```
</div>



## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Slide presentations 

```{r startMDPres.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDPres.png")
```



## R Markdown Basics
**Creating an R Markdown Document**

- Truly Interactive Documents/Pages (requires R backend)

```{r startMDShiny.png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/startMDShiny.png")
```

## R Markdown Basics

- Create an HTML Markdown document!
```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Justin Post"
date: "August 10, 2017"
output: html_document
---
```  

 - Top section:  YAML header     
 
> - Define settings for document  

> - Author, Title, etc.  

> - Output type/Options  


     
## R Markdown Basics
     
 - Below YAML header: 'r chunk'  

```{r chunk_png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunk.png")
```  

> - Start code chunk by typing ```{r} out or with CTRL/CMD + Alt + I

> - Code will be executed when document is created    

> - Can specify options on individual code chunks  


## R Markdown Basics
     
- Below code chunk is plain text with markdown sytnax  

```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. 
```

- When file created, "##" becomes a header, "<...>" a link, and ```**Knit**``` bold font

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. 


## Where do we go from here?  

- Figure out markdown syntax  

> - Look at "Notebook" feature  

> - Check options for code chunks  

> - Change type of output  

> - Work with interactivity (shiny)  


## R Markdown Syntax Can Include...  

> - Plain text  
> - End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph  
  <ul>  
      <li> Line breaks are not always added when you return!</li>
      <li> Two spaces and a return drop marked up text down.</li>
      <li> Can specify ```<br>```  as a line break</li>
  </ul>  
  
> - ```*italics*``` *and* ```_italics_```  

> - ```**bold**``` **and** ```__bold__```

> - ```superscript^2^``` becomes superscript^2^  

> - ```~~strikethrough~~```  becomes ~~strikethrough~~

> - Modify text in your .Rmd file and click Knit -> Knit to HTML (at the top)  


## R Markdown Syntax  

- ```[link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)``` becomes [link](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)  

> - ```# Header 1``` becomes a large font header  

> - ```## Header 2``` becomes a slightly smaller font header  

> - Goes to 6 headers  

> - Use of headers can automatically create a Table of Contents!

> - Include an image: ```![](path/to/file.png)```    

> - \`code\` becomes `code`  

> - Modify text in your .Rmd file and click Knit -> Knit to HTML (at the top)  


## R Markdown Syntax

- Can do lists: be sure to end each line with two spaces!  
  + Indent sub lists four spaces   

<div style = "float: left; width: 50%">
```
* unordered list  
* item 2  

  + sub-item 1  
  + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  

  + sub-item 1  
  + sub-item 2  
```  
</div>
<div style = "float: right; width: 50%">
* unordered list  
* item 2  

    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  

    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  
</div>



## R Markdown Syntax

- Can customize things if you know HTML (a little)  

`<div style = "float: left; width: 50%">`  

```
* unordered list  
```  

`</div>`

`<div style = "float: right; width: 50%">`  

* unordered list  

`</div>`


## R Markdown Syntax  

- Can include nice tables  

```
Table Header  | Second Header | Col 3
------------- | ------------- | -----------
Table Cell    | Cell (1, 2)   | Cell (1, 3)
Cell (2, 1)   | Cell (2, 2)   | Cell (2, 3) 
```
Table Header  | Second Header | Col 3
------------- | ------------- | -----------
Table Cell    | Cell (1, 2)   | Cell (1, 3)
Cell (2, 1)   | Cell (2, 2)   | Cell (2, 3) 

<br>  

> - Add a list and a table in your .Rmd file and click Knit -> Knit to HTML (at the top)

## Where are we at?  

- R Markdown Basics  
    + **Code Chunks**  
    + **Images/Equations/Misc.**

- R Markdown Options
    + Documents: PDF, HTML 
    + Presentations: Slides
    + Interactive Components
    
- R Shiny Applications/Presentations


## Code Chunks  

We've already seen how to include an R code chunk:
```{r chunk.png, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunk.png")
```   

- Add chunk via typing   
\`\`\`{r}  
code  
\`\`\`

- or `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`  

- Any R code can go into the chunk  

> - Code can be added in line:  Ex: Iris has `r length(iris$Sepal.Length)` observations  

> - Added by beginning with back-tick `r` and ending with a back-tick: Iris has \`r `length(iris$Sepal.Length)`\`  


## Notebook Functionality  

Data science notebook - virtual notebook environment used for literate programming  

 - Pairs the functionality of word processing software with a programming language

 - R Markdown brings together the console and the script editor too!  
 - Rendered markdown document captures R code and process  

[NHL Example html](https://github.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/blob/master/files/GetData.html?raw=true), [NHL Example Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/master/files/GetData.Rmd)



## Notebook Functionality  

Within a chunk:  

 - Execute code with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter` or with "Run"  

```{r chunkRun.png, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chunkRun.png")
```  

> - Results show up in editor!  


## Notebook Functionality  

 - Allows for quick iteration within a chunk: editing and re-executing - when you are happy, you move on and start a new chunk.  

> - Can run all code chunks with `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + R`  

> - Can develop code and record your thoughts - similar to classic lab notebook in the physical sciences  

> - Go back to markdown template document, execute code chunk in-line and all code chunks.  Add an inline code piece.  


## Back to Code Chunks  

- Many options depending on chunk purpose!    

> - Can hide/show code with `echo = FALSE/TRUE`  

> - Can choose if code is evaluated with `eval = TRUE/FALSE`   

> - `Include = FALSE` is equivalent to `echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE`    

> - `message = TRUE/FALSE` and `warning = TRUE/FALSE` can turn on/off displaying messages/warnings   

> - `error = TRUE` allows file to be created with code that has an error  


## Back to Code Chunks  

> - Options useful for set-up code (usually first chunk after YAML header) 

> - Can set global options for all chunks  

> - Allows for easy change of audience!  


## Back to Code Chunks  

- Options useful for set-up code (usually first chunk after YAML header) 

- Can set global options for all chunks  

- Allows for easy change of audience!  

For a higher up  
```
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

For a collaborator  
```
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```


## Code Chunks  

Can name code chunks to help organization!  

- When calling a chunk, add name after `r`    

\`\`\`{r name-of-chunk, options...}   
code  
\`\`\`


## Code Chunks  

Can name code chunks to help organization!  

- When calling a chunk, add name after `r`    

\`\`\`{r name-of-chunk, options...}   
code  
\`\`\`

> - TOC type menu in bottom left of notebook editor!  

```{r TOC.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/TOC.png")
```

## Code Chunks

In a large analysis it may take a long time to run code chunks/knit your document  

> - Can "Cache" results!  Code will only rerun if it has changed.  

> - Option to set up code dependencies using chunk names

> - Use `cache = TRUE` in code chunk definition

> - Delete folders created to rerun everything  


## Code Chunks

In a large analysis it may take a long time to run code chunks/knit your document  

 - Can "Cache" results!  Code will only rerun if it has changed.  

 - Option to set up code dependencies using chunk names

 - Use `cache = TRUE` in code chunk definition

 - Delete folders created to rerun everything  

 - Modify *global options* in `setup` R chunk after your YAML header.  Make changes and see differences!  (Local settings overwrite global.)  (Add `library(tidyverse)` to a code chunk to have messages that would pop up!)

```
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```


## Images/Equations and Misc.

Adding images in markdown: `![](path/to/file)`  

> - Not ideal... difficult to control size/scale  

> - Better way to add images use R code!  

> - `knitr` package has `include_graphics` function  

> - Use knitr or code chunk options to control size/scale!

> - Ex:  
\`\`\`{r graphics, out.width = "800px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path/to/file)  
\`\`\`


## Images/Equations and Misc.

Adding Equations  

> - Inline equation: ```$A = \pi*r^{2}$``` becomes $A = \pi*r^{2}$  

> - Block equation ```$$A = \pi*r^{2}$$``` becomes $$A = \pi*r^{2}$$  

> - Outputting equations for HTML is done through MathJax (javascript)  

> - For PDFs it is done through LaTeX (may need to install)  


## Images/Equations and Misc.

Outputting data tables better with `kable` from `knitr` package

<div style = "float: left; width = 35%;">
```{r kable, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```
</div>
<div style = "float: right; width = 60%;">
```{r kable2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
kable(summary(cars))
```
</div>

## Where are we at?  

- R Markdown Basics  
    + Code Chunks
    + Images/Equations/Misc.

- R Markdown Options
    + Documents: PDF, HTML 
    + Presentations: Slides
    + Interactive Components

- R Shiny Applications/Presentations



## Common Outputs  

R Markdown really flexible!  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/compile.png")
```


## Common Outputs  

Change output type in the YAML header:  

- HTML (a web page)  
```
output:  html_document  
```

Use code explicity:  

`rmarkdown::render("file.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")`

Use Knit menu:  
```{r knit, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/knit.png")
```


## Common Outputs
For HTML can include Table of Contents with options    

```
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
```

## Common Outputs  

For HTML can include Table of Contents with options    

```
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
```

For html_documents another option is to make the code chunks hidden by default, but visible with a click:

```
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
```


## Common Outputs  

- PDF  

```
output: pdf_document   
```
  

## Common Outputs  

- PDF  

```
output: pdf_document   
```
  

- Word  

```
output: word_document
```

> - Go back to template, change output type to word and knit.  Add [some HTML options](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) (careful to drop down lines and use spacing as done in documentation).


## Creating PDFs  

- Can change type of output to PDF  

- Many [PDF options](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)  

- Rendering to PDF can be a bit difficult to set up if you don't do latex  

- Go through [this document](https://github.com/jbpost2/IntermediateR/raw/master/files/MarkdownOutputToPDF.pdf) (we'll come help!) to set things up  


## Common Outputs  

Presentations/Slides (new slides with `##`)  

> - `output: ioslides_presentation` - HTML presentation

> - `slidy_presentation` - HTML presentation

> - `beamer_presentation` - PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer


## Common Outputs  

Presentations/Slides (new slides with `##`)   

- `output: ioslides_presentation` - HTML presentation

- `slidy_presentation` - HTML presentation

- `beamer_presentation` - PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer

- Shiny (covered later) slides   

```
runtime: shiny
output: html_document
```
or 
```
runtime: shiny
output: ioslides_presentation
```

## Interactivity  

HTML documents inherently interactive  

- Widgets can be included  

```{r leafletP, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  setView(174.764, -36.877, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(174.764, -36.877, popup = "Maungawhau") 
```

## Interactivity    

```{r leafletE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  setView(174.764, -36.877, zoom = 16) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(174.764, -36.877, popup = "Maungawhau") 
```

## Interactivity   

Interactive tables with `DT` library

```{r DTP, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```

## Interactivity   

```{r DTE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```


## Interactivity 

- 3d scatterplots with `rthreejs` package  
```{r scatter3dP, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bwlewis/rthreejs")

library(threejs)

scatterplot3js(x = iris$Sepal.Width, y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
							 z = iris$Petal.Width, color = 
							 	c(rep("blue", 50), rep("red", 50), 
							 		rep("green", 50)), 
							 size = 0.5)
```

## Interactivity 
```{r scatter3dE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(threejs)

scatterplot3js(x = iris$Sepal.Width, y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
							 z = iris$Petal.Width, color = 
							 	c(rep("blue", 50), rep("red", 50), 
							 		rep("green", 50)), 
							 size = 0.5)
```


## Interactivity  

Previous interactivity happened in the browser  

> - Great because anyone can access with a browser  

> - Bad because you can't have as much functionality as you want...

> - Shiny allows for interactivity with R!  

> - Only con: Requires R running somewhere

> - Examples: [Shiny Showcase](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-user-showcase/), [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

## Course Plan  

- R Projects  

- Markdown basics  

- Git & Github  

- Creating a blog & website with R and github

- Automating R Markdown

- Writing a Book with bookdown  

- Creating interactive apps with R shiny  


## RStudio Project

- Often have many files associated with an analysis  

- With multiple analyses things get cluttered  


## RStudio Project

- Often have many files associated with an analysis  

- With multiple analyses things get cluttered  

- Want to associate different  
<ul>
   <li> environments </li>
   <li> histories </li>
   <li> working directories </li>
   <li> source documents </li>
</ul> 
with each analysis

> - Can use "Project" feature in R Studio  


## RStudio - Project

- Easy to create!  Use an existing folder or create one:

```{r project.png, out.width = "600px",echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/project.png")
```

- Place all files for that analysis in that directory  


## RStudio - Project  

Create two new projects (with new empty folders):  

- One called 'github_website'  

- One called 'automation_of_markdown'  

(We'll also create one later from git.)

- On creation select the `renv` option  


## RStudio - Project

- Let's look at project options via `tools --> Project options`  

- Switch between projects with the upper right menu

- Modify and save the project.  Note the differing behavior of your R sessoin depending on your project options

- Open the .Rproj file in notepad


## Markdown Basics  

- Vital to make your work reproducible!  

> - Traditional documentation through comments (`#` in R) in script

> - May have heard of [JUPYTER](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks  

> - R Markdown - built in notebook for R studio (a program that weaves word processing and code)


## Creating an R Markdown Document

- Work in your 'github_website' project  

- Create a new markdown doc via menus and let's explore it!

```{r startMD.png, out.width = "700px",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/startMD.png")
```


## Markdown **Verbage**

- May have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
    
## Markdown **Verbage**

- May have heard of HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)  
    + Write plain text that the browser interprets and renders  
    
- Markdown is a specific markup language  
    + Easier syntax  
    + Not as powerful  
    
- Any plain text file can be used (.Rmd extension associates it with R Studio)


## R Markdown  

R Markdown file contains three important types of content:

1. (Optional) YAML header surrounded by `---`s  

2. Chunks of R code   

3. Text mixed with simple text formatting instructions 



## R Markdown - **YAML Header**  

 - Define settings for document  

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "First Last"
date: "xxxx"
output: html_document
---
```  

- CTRL/CMD + Shift + k **knits** (creates the output document) via this info  

- Can also knit via the little arrow to knit to a different format  

- Can knit via the `rmarkdown::render()` function


## R Markdown - **Code Chunks**  

 - Below YAML header: 'r chunk'  

```{r chunk_png, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/chunk.png")
```  

> - Start code chunk by typing ```{r} out or with CTRL/CMD + Alt/Option + I

> - Code will be executed when document is created    

> - Can specify options on individual code chunks  


## R Markdown - **Syntax**
     
- Below code chunk is plain text with markdown sytnax  

```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. 
```

- When file created, "##" becomes a header, "<...>" a link, and ```**Knit**``` bold font


## R Markdown - **Syntax**

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. 


## Markdown

Syntax is really easy to learn via the [Cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) 

Quick look at the following:  

- Markdown syntax  

- Code chunks and their options  

- Changing type of output  


## **R Markdown syntax**  

- ```# Header 1``` becomes a large font header  

- ```## Header 2``` becomes a slightly smaller font header  

- Goes to 6 headers  

    + Use of headers can automatically create a Table of Contents!

> - ```**bold**``` **and** ```__bold__```

> - \`code\` becomes `code`  


## **R Markdown syntax**  

- Can do lists: be sure to end each line with two spaces!  

    + Indent sub lists four spaces  

<div style = "float: left; width: 50%">
```
* unordered list  
* item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  
```  
</div>
<div style = "float: right; width: 50%">
* unordered list  
* item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  

1. ordered list  
2. item 2  
    + sub-item 1  
    + sub-item 2  
</div>


## **Code chunks and their options**  

- Any R code can go into a chunk  

> - Usually a 'set-up' chunk at the top to read in packages, set global chunk options, etc.  

> - Chunks evaluate sequentially (can use output from prior chunk) that is saved as an R object - let's check that!


## **Code chunks and their options**  

- Many options depending on chunk purpose!    

- Can hide/show code with `echo = FALSE/TRUE`  

- Can choose if code is evaluated with `eval = TRUE/FALSE`   

- `message = TRUE/FALSE` and `warning = TRUE/FALSE` can turn on/off displaying messages/warnings   

```{r, fig.align='center', message = FALSE, out.width=275, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/codeChunkGear.PNG")
```


## Documenting with Markdown  

- R Markdown = Digital "Notebook":  Program that weaves word processing and code.  

- Designed to be used in three ways (R for Data Science)  
<ul>
  <li>Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code)</li>
  <li>Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!)  </li>
  <li> As environment to do data science (can evaluate and edit/reevaluate code chunks and document what you did and what you were thinking)</li>
</ul>


## **Changing type of output**  

R Markdown really flexible!  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/compile.png")
```


## **Changing type of output**  

R Markdown really flexible!  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/compile.png")
```

- Change output type in the YAML header and use CTRL/CMD + Shift + k

- knit via the menu  

- Use code explicity:  
    `rmarkdown::render("file.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")`

> - Outputting to PDF requires a version of Tex.  If you don't have one, install the `tinytex` package and run `tinytex::install_tinytex()`  

> - Check that you can output to HTML, PDF, and Word using one of the above methods  

## Other Options on Outputs  

Check out [the R Markdown definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html) for cool options for each type of output!  

- Try to implement code folding, tabsets, and a TOC in an HTML output doc. Can you do it via `render`?

- Try to implement the kable method of printing a data frame and a TOC in a PDF.  Can you do it via `render`?


## Output to multiple formats  

Multiple outputs in one call:

- `rmarkdown::render("yourfile.Rmd", output_format = c("html_document", "pdf_document", "word_document")`

- You can also change the name of the output files via the `output_file` argument  

- Can you get it to output three files called 'my.html', 'your.pdf', 'their.docx' with one function call?

- Let's try it!  (Note: You can't specify options when rendering to multiple formats)

## R Markdown  

- Great for document your code/thoughts and for sharing your analyses easily!  

- Next, we'll learn about git/github and how RStudio can work with them

- A similar Markdown language is used to render documents on github so we've already learned enough to create some basic webpages too :)


## What are git and github?

Ideally we want to document our process, easily collaborate, and widely share our work

- To make our workflow for a project reproducible, ideally we would save different versions of our analysis, write-up, etc. along the way 

- git is a version control software that easily allows multiple users to work on the **same** project.  It simply tracks the changes that we `commit` to the files.

> - No more finaldoc.pdf, finalfinaldoc.pdf, finaldoc08_11_21.pdf, ...

> - github is a hosting service that allows us to do Git-based projects on the internet and share them widely!


## Tracking:  Basic idea 

- Create a repository on github.com (files saved remotely)

> - When you (or collaborator) want to work on it, you `clone` the repo locally (or `pull` the files down to update it)  

> - You work, save things, etc.  

> - Your work was good!  Nice.  Now you want to `add` your modified/new files to the repo so other can use them.  

> - You then stage your `commit` (i.e. prepare everything to send back to the remote repo)  

> - You `push` your local committed changes up the the repo on github 

> - Everyone has access to it now!  


## Collaboration: Basic idea

Everyone can work on the same branch and update as needed (sometimes there will be merge conflicts, covered shortly)  

> - People often `fork` the repo or create their own `branch` to work on, rather than modify the main repository

> - Perhaps the main repo is being used for something and you don't want to `push` up your changes until they are tested or the new 'feature' is debugged  

> - You work on your branch using the idea from the previous slide  

> - Once happy with everything, you do a `merge` request to combine your modified repo with the main repo branch  


## Visual 
(from https://git.logikum.hu)  

Each circle represents a 'commit' to that repository/branch (all version of files at each commit are kept!)

```{r, out.width='55%', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/gitexample.svg")
```

## Wow - How do we get started??  

Let's look at an [example repo](https://github.com/jbpost2/TeachingWithR) and the commits done/how it is tracked!  

> - Start with basic workflow with yourself by creating a blog on github!  

## Blog Instructions  

- Sign into github.com and then go to [this repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)

- Click `fork` in the top right corner.  This will give you a copy of this repo under your account! Under settings, rename the repo to yourname.github.io

- Visit https://yourgithubusername.github.io to see the default blog page (i.e. you already have a blog :)  


## Blog Instructions  

- Let's make some changes!  Click on the `_posts` folder.  Edit the file you see there by clicking on the name.  You can then click on the pencil in the right hand header for the file display.  

    - Change the file name to today's date.  
    - Update the title in the YAML header. 
    - Use the markdown syntax we learned to write a short paragraph or two (no R code chunks though!)
    - Write a commit message under 'Commit changes' and click the green button at the bottom  
    
- It may take 2 minutes but visit https://yourgithubusername.github.io again to see the changes.  



## Cloning the repo  

- To follow our previous idea (and to start doing this with R), we really don't want to use the web interface  

- We can `clone` the repo (i.e. download the entire repo locally)  

- Repo main page has a green button.  Click on that.  

    + Can download a zip and unzip it to an appropriate folder  
    + Can clone via the URL and terminal or RStudio  
    
- Open RStudio, go to new project, from Version Control, choose Git, and paste in the repo link.  Select a directory to save this in and hit Create project!

- Now have the files locally!  


## Update check

We need to make sure RStudio and github can communicate.  Do the following:

- Go to the `Git` tab in your `Environment` area  

- You should see some files there.  These are the ones that have changed from the remote repo (the one on github)  

- Here you can add files that you'd like to commit up to the remote repo  

- Click on all of the boxes (equivalent to `git add -A`) and click the `Commit` button  


## Update check  

- This brings up a window that allows you to compare changes.  If you are happy you can put a commit message in the box in the top right and click the commit button (equivalent to `git commit -m "message"`)  

- Hit close on the window (you should see no errors, just a message about the commit)  

- Now click the push button in the top right (equivalent to `git push`)  

- You should be prompted to log-in in some way.  Do so!  

- Go to your repo on gitub.com and see the changes!  


## Alternative to the Menu

When working by myself on a repo, I'm not worried about merge conflicts with other people's changes.  As such, my workflow is as follows:  

- Open the appropriate project in RStudio

- Go to the Terminal (switched to Bash) and type `git pull` (or use the git tab)  

- Work... at a good spot for saving, back to the terminal

- Type `git add -A` to add all files that have been modified

- Type `git commit -m "Message"` to stage a commit  

- Type `git push` to push the local changes to the remote repo  


## Try Out the Workflow  

- Go to your blog repo and make a change via the web interface

- Your local repo is no longer up to date!  (Type `git status` in the terminal to check). You'll need to pull down the changes.  

- Now, let's update from RStudio!  

- Update the about page of your blog by editing 'about.md'.  Make changes like before and commit!  

- Push up the changes.  In 2-3 minutes you should see the About page updates :)  


## Creating a Repo

Let's create a repo with our already created 'github_website' project

- Go to github.com and create a repo with that name (Use the + in the top right corner - don't initiate a git ignore file)

- Open the github_website project we worked on earlier

- Go to Tools --> Project Options --> Git (restart R as requested)

- Now in the terminal do the following:

    + `git remote add origin [paste the clone link here]`  (initiate the tracking of the project on github)
    + `git pull origin main`  (download all remote files)
    + `git push -u origin main` (track changes on this machine)  

- Add, commit, and push your files up!


## Creating a website

Very easy!  Two steps:  

- Enable github pages in your repo settings (on github.com)  
- Create a README.Rmd file.  Change the output type to `github_document`  

> - Write whatever R code you want, add, commit, and push up your changes  

> - Now you'll have a site like https://jbpost2.github.io/github_website/  


## Automating R Markdown  

Let's take a break from git!  

- Other markdown functionality: Using `parameters`  

- Can be added to the YAML header and can be used to automate reports!

 - Suppose we are dealing with a football box score data set  
 
```{r, message = FALSE}
NFLData <- read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/scoresFull.csv")
NFLData
```
 

## Markdown Parameters  

Parameters can be added to the YAML header  
 
```
title: "NFL Reports"
author: "Justin Post"
output: html_document  
params: 
      team: "Pittsburgh Steelers"
```
- Can 'Knit with parameters'  

- In .Rmd, access via `params$team`  

> - Example: Let's open up the [NFL.Rmd document](https://jbpost2.github.io/R-for-Automating-Workflow-Sharing-Work/slides/NFL.Rmd)


## Parameters  

May want to create a similar document/output for all 32 teams  

- Utilize code method for knitting the document

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("NFL.Rmd", output_file = "Cleveland Browns.html", 
									params = list(team = "Cleveland Browns"))
```

- Would create same document using the Cleveland Browns data


## Parameters  

Plan:  

- Create data frame that has  

    + file names to output to  
    
    + list with each team name for using in `render()`

For one team the row would be (last column's value is really a list with one value in it)  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(output_file = "Pittsburgh Steelers.html", params = list(team = "Pittsburgh Steelers"))
```

## Parameters  

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#get unique teams
teamIDs <- unique(NFLData$awayTeam)
#create filenames
output_file <- paste0(teamIDs, ".html")
#create a list for each team with just the team name parameter
params = lapply(teamIDs, FUN = function(x){list(team = x)})

#put into a data frame 
reports <- tibble(output_file, params)
```

## Parameters  

```{r}
reports
```

## Parameters  

Now knit using `apply()` or via `purrr::pwalk()` 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(rmarkdown)
#need to use x[[1]] to get at elements since tibble doesn't simplify
apply(reports, MARGIN = 1, 
			FUN = function(x){
				render(input = "files/NFL.Rmd", output_file = x[[1]], params = x[[2]])
				})

#or with pwalk (args are .l, .f, and ...)
#.l is a list of lists, .f is function, formula, or vector
pwalk(reports, render, input = "files/NFL.Rmd")
```


## Parameters  

This can be done with multiple parameters.  

- Nice way to automate creation  

- Could put into a nice pipeline  

    + Create file to update NFL data each week (scrape new data and add to .csv file)  
    
    + Create .Rmd file that you want for each team  
    
    + Create file to submit creation of documents with params  
    
    + Put all into one file (say with `source`)  
    
    + [Have that file automatically run](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-automate-r-scripts-on-windows-and-mac/)!  
    

## Try it yourself!

Try to do a similar process where you use the `iris` data frame and create three separate analysis based off of the `Species` column.  

- Create a parameter called `species`

- Run the following code in your markdown doc:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
myIris <- filter(iris, params$species)
summary(myIris)
plot(myIris)
```

- Use `apply()` or `pwalk()` to generate the three reports.  


## Bookdown

- You can easily write a book using RStudio too!  

- Can be done via File --> New Directory --> Book Project Using bookdown

- Instead we'll clone [this repo](https://github.com/jbpost2/myBook) and then create an R project from a git repository  

- Let's see how to build the book!  

- Chapters are just .Rmd files (named appropriately `01-intro.Rmd`) that start with a `#`  


## Merging Branches  

- Seems like a good idea to talk about merging branches!  

- If you do a commit on your branch, you may notice something like this

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="59%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/forkcommit.png")
```

## Merging Branches

Suppose you like your commit and you think I will too!  

- You can do a `pull` request  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="79%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pullrequest.png")
```



## Merging Branches

Suppose you like your commit and you think I will too!  

- You can do a `pull` request  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="75%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pullinfo.png")
```


## Merging Branches

If you are lucky, there won't be any merge conflicts.  

- Allows the owner of the original repo to accept the pull request without needing to modify things

- The owner will get a notification that a pull request has been made

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="45%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pullrequestnoted.png")
```


## Merging Branches

Owner can then investigate the request and choose whether or not to accept it or they can ask for more details

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/pullcheck2.png")
```


## Dealing with conflicts 

- Sometimes changes requested conflict with changes already made  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/mergeconflict.png")
```


## Dealing with conflicts 

Owner sees a notification about conflicts that must be resolved  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/resolve.png")
```


## Dealing with conflicts 

They can view the issues and pick which to include or to include both with a modification  

`<<<<<<<` is a conflict marker  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="70%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/resolve2.png")
```

- Figure out what to do and delete the `<<< === >>>` lines
